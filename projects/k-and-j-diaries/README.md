K and J Diaries was a project that required only HTML and CSS. The project was to copy the first page of a website exactly without inspecting the original code. Bootstrap could be used to make things easier. The URL that it was copied from is "https://web.archive.org/web/20161003210028/http://kandjdiaries.com/"
