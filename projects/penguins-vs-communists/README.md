Penguins vs. Communists
====================

Penguins vs. Communists is a project that was used to test our ability to create another game that could be used to have two parties fight, in this case those two partis are penguins and communists. Each one will have a chance to attack first with a 50% odds. Used Readline-sync to run in the terminal.
