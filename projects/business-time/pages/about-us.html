									<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founded on March 10th of 2017 Tri-Enterprises is growing faster than we have ever grown. Our growth is projected to continue growing for awhile now, at least a few weeks, and we can say that confidently almost. </li>

									<p>We're a bunch of losers who got together and actually made a decent idea. This idea is that we can develop a network of those who would like top make money and push them to help multiply their annual income.</p>
									<li class="reasons-list">How we do it</li>
									<p>Upon joining the company you will be asked for a contribution of some sort. This could be anything from money to, well we pretty much only want money nothing else interests us. Once this donation is recieved we will pool all of the money recieved together and invest it in the companies that we believe will be growing in the next couple of years. We're firm believers that the paper industry is about to get a lot bigger with the popularization of the hit TV show "The Office&trade;" It can be safe to assume that that is what we will be putting most of your money into based purely on our beliefs.</p>
									<li class="reasons-list">Company Backgrounds</li>
									<p>Currently everyone that works for the company has had great success in the industry. After meetng at a great institute and spending a few years with eachother we all decided this would work great as a great and completley "legal" way to make money for all of us. This company has been thought up for about the average length of jail time for embezzlement, we used that as a reference for time because it seemed convienent and we can assure you that one of us doesn't have any type of serious criminal backgrounds just your basic petty theft. You can refer to the Funding page if you want to learn more about how you can help give yourself potentially more time away from the old ball and chain, because let's be honest you're probably bored of them adn we've all had serious breaks from our spouses and let us tell you that there isn't a greater thing in the world</p>
