Tech Wish List
====================

This exercise required us to build a website that displays a technology wish list. It was required to have two pages, one that shows a list of desired computer/phone tech and another list for other tech. Required ngroute, each view was required to have its own associated controller, as well as a way to navigate between two views. Must use directives on each template and the website is required to be visually pleasing. Later had to add a filter to change all the prices to Euros.
